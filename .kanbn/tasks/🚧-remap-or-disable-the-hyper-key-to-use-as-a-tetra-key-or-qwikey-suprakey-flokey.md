# ðŸš§ Remap or Disable the Hyper Key to use as a TetraKey (or Qwikey/Suprakey/Flokey)

Hmm. I kinda like 'Flokey'; it keeps with the "FLO-" prefix.

Current Hyperkey combinations in Office:
- W: Word
- T:  Teams
- Y:  https://yammer.com  (Yammer?? Seriously??)
- O: Outlook
- P: PowerPoint
- D: OneDrive
- L: LinkedIn
- X: Excel
- N: OneDrive

## Sub-tasks

- [ ] Commit: Add FLO-Key option to disable Office Shortcuts (Default is to not do it)
- [ ] Commit: Open Application Mode: [Flowkey] +[A]... better than [Ctrl][Alt][Shift]+[o]
- [ ] Commit: Open Browse Mode: [Flowkey]+[b]  (migrate from quikey): INCLUDE CLIPBOARD if text is selected
- [ ] Commit: PowerToys utils Mode: [Flowkey]+[U]tils, then flowqlix mouse buttons (alwaysOnTop, findMouseCursor, ZoomItDraw, ColorPicker, AdvancedPaste, SoundSwitch)
- [ ] Commit: Clipboard utilities: [Flowkey]+[C] after selecting text - goToSite, thesaurus, yt search, sendToOpenAI
