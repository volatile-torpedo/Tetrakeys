This is the documentation for the FLOW Stasis project.

The project is developed by the [FLOW Team].

Many of us suffer from Time Blindness, which is a common symptom of ADHD. Time blindness is the inability to judge the passage of time. This can be a major source of stress and anxiety for many people. The Time Reminders feature is designed to help you stay on track and manage your time more effectively. You can set up reminders to alert you when a certain amount of time has passed. This can help you stay focused and on task, and prevent you from getting lost in time.
